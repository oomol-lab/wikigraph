# Evidence Selection

`evidence-selection` owns the shared evidence positioning protocol used by
Reading Graph and Knowledge Graph builders.

The module accepts plain source sentence candidates and model-generated
evidence selections, then resolves them to sentence IDs. It does not know about
reader chunks, wikilink relations, entities, mentions, triples, `.wikg`
archives, or WikiGraph URIs.

## Public Protocol

New prompts should ask the model to return:

```json
[
  {
    "sentence_id": "S1",
    "quote": "exact short source quote"
  }
]
```

Each item points to one source sentence. Use multiple items when a claim needs
multiple source sentences. `sentence_id` is the model's primary selection.
`quote` is copied from the visible source text and is used to validate or
correct sentence drift. Callers are responsible for mapping external sentence
labels such as `S1` back to their own sentence IDs.

The module also retains the older anchor resolver because existing retry
responses and tests still exercise that shape. New prompts should prefer the
selection protocol above.

`quote` should be short enough to be cheap but distinctive enough to identify
the intended sentence. It is compared against visible source text after shared
normalization; callers that include markup such as mention tags in their prompt
must strip or normalize those tags before passing sentences to this module.

## Responsibilities

- Normalize evidence text according to the shared surface-normalization
  contract.
- Score exact, normalized, and fuzzy quote matches against candidate sentences.
- Resolve one or more `sentence_id + quote` selections to sentence IDs.
- Return ranked candidates when a quote is ambiguous or low confidence.
- Provide prompt fragments and JSON-shape snippets that callers can embed.

## Boundary Rules

- Callers pass source sentences as plain text plus caller-owned sentence IDs.
- This module must not import Reading Graph or Knowledge Graph business objects.
- This module must not construct chunk, relation, mention, entity, triple, or URI
  objects.
- Recovery loops remain caller-owned because each graph builder has different
  retry semantics and result objects.
- The module may return ambiguity or low-confidence candidates, but it does not
  decide whether a graph builder should retry, accept the model's sentence ID,
  drop a partial result, or ask the model to choose from candidates.
